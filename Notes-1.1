. is class in class
We created .my-custom-style {}
then we can use this attribute easily in any tag we want.
We use the attribute as following in the opening tag:
  eg: <h1 class="my-class-style"> 






<style> 


We must use . at the beginning
  .my-custom-style { 
      color: brown;
      background-color: white;
      font-size: 20px;
      font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
    }
 p{ color:red;} 


we must use id for once!
There has to be # at the beginning
 #my-unique-id{
     color: darkblue;
    font-family: cursive;
    font-size: 25px;
 }

if we use more than once it is better to use class attribute

.my-custom-style { 
    text-align: center;
    color: brown;
    background-color: white;
    font-size: 20px;
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
    width: 300px;
  }

</style>

<br> and <hr> does not have closing tag
